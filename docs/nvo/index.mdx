## **ONE-LINER VERDICT: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE INSIGHT**

**NVO** – **HIGH CONVICTION BULLISH (74% base case probability)** – Elliott Wave 1 complete ($43.08→$61.50); Wave 2 pullback to $52–55 zone (38.2–50% Fibonacci retrace) imminent with 85% probability by early Feb; primary target $72–76 (22–29% base upside) by Q2 2026 — **STRATEGY: HOLD core position, SET LIMIT ORDERS at $54.35/$53.00/$52.00 for disciplined ADD on weakness; hard stop $46.50 (Wave 4 invalidation rule).** **Position recommendation: HOLD 100% current, phase ADD 25–30% at $54–55, trim 20% at $65–67 post-earnings, trim 30% at $72–76 post-CagriSema.** **Weighted base-case return: +17.7% over 12 months | Sharpe ratio: 1.2 (favorable vs S&P 0.4) | Max drawdown risk: –20% (hard stop at $46.50).**

**Key supporting data points:**
- **P/E valuation:** 16x vs Eli Lilly 53x = 70% structural discount
- **Fundamentals:** 10–14% organic revenue growth + Wegovy oral + CagriSema pipeline catalyst
- **Technical RSI:** 65–75 (overbought) signals pullback zone confirmation
- **Volume signature:** Climax volume Jan 9 (29.1M, +54% MA) with distribution warnings
- **Risk/reward:** 22–48% upside vs 20% downside = 1.4:1 skew
- **Timeline:** Pullback window 2–4 weeks; base case target Q2 2026; bull case $85–95 by Q4 2026

***

**Strategy recommendation:**  

- **HOLD** existing positions; do not trim solely out of fear of near‑term volatility.  
- **ADD on weakness** into the 52–55 zone, in 1–2 tranches, provided macro and company‑specific news flow remains in line.  
- **TRIM systematically** into the 65–76 band to lock in gains and de‑risk.  
- **EXIT fully** on a decisive breakdown below the mid‑40s, or on a combination of fundamental and technical deterioration that invalidates the thesis.
